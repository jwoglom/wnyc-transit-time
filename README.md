This repo contains a fixed version of WNYC's Transit Time calculator from [project.wnyc.org/transit-time](http://project.wnyc.org/transit-time).

Due to Mapbox API changes, the version live on WNYC's website no longer works.
The code in this repo is owned by WNYC and contains minimal changes to their front-end JavaScript
(specifically, upgrading the version of the Mapbox JavaScript API and adding an API key)
that allow the webapp to function properly.

Please refer to the credits section of the webapp for credit to the original authors.
